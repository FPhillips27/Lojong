Lojong is a webapp which displays Tibetan Buddhism's Lojong Slogans. The Slogans are a set of aphorisms designed to help you overcome undesired mental habits.

This app is in no way a replacement for meeting with a teacher or reading a book on the Lojong Slogans. They'll go into more detail than I ever could. The goal of this app is to introduce people to the slogans and encourage them to learn more.

You can see this app here: https://lojong-slogans.herokuapp.com/
